# Username Generator

## Goal(s) of the demo:

* Work with the `substring()` method from the String class.

  * This method is overloaded. `substring(int a)` will create a substring from index a until the end.

  * `substring(int a, int b)` will create a substring from index *a* until, but not including index *b*.

* `indexOf(String ch)` is a method from the String class that reports the index (position) of the first occurrence of the substring *ch*. **If the substring does not exist, then the method will report -1.**

* `lastIndexOf()` may also be helpful, but wasn't needed here.

* `+= ` when adding characters to a String.
