# Tax

### Guidelines:
Write a complete Java file to address the following:
* Create a class called Receipt.
* Write a main method that does the following:
  * Gets user input (double, or int) that represents a price.
  * Call a method `addTax()` that takes in that price and adds tax.
  * Output the final price that included tax.
* Write the method `addTax()` that takes in a price returns the amount plus an 8.25% tax.

For example, if the user were to input $100, $108.25 would be displayed.
